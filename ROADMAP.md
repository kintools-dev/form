# Roadmap

Where Kin Form is headed, and roughly in what order. This is the public summary;
day-to-day tracking happens in [TODO.md](./TODO.md) and the issue tracker.

Guiding principle: everything shipped either teaches a concept or builds trust.

## Done: trust and clarity

- Governance basics: `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR
  templates (this file included)
- CI running on every push and pull request, not only on release tags
- Docs homepage rewritten to lead with why the library exists, not the
  feature/benchmark grid
- `llms.txt`, a sitemap, and standard meta tags on the docs site
- Lit bindings shipped as `@kintools/form-lit`
- Published to npm alongside JSR

## In progress: teach and prove

- Honest, dedicated comparison pages against React Hook Form and TanStack Form
- A regular cadence of engineering articles about the underlying problems (forms
  as trees, stable identity, controlled vs. uncontrolled, API design you don't
  have to memorize), not product marketing
- Next.js/RSC, shadcn/ui, and MUI integration guides and examples
- An SSR guide
- Migration guides from React Hook Form and Formik
- Benchmarks reproduced in a real browser, not only in Happy DOM

## Later: scale

- Further framework bindings (Vue/Solid) on top of the already
  framework-agnostic `core`, once there's a real reason to, not to look active
  (Lit bindings already shipped as `@kintools/form-lit`)
- Expanding `@kintools/form-validators` based on real issues filed, not
  speculative gaps

## Explicitly not a priority

- Chasing benchmark wins as the pitch
- Copying every competitor feature
- Spinning up new packages for their own sake
- Treating GitHub stars as a goal rather than a byproduct
